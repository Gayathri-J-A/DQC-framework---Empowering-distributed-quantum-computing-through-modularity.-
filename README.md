A Groundbreaking Modular Quantum Compilation Framework designed specifically for Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) architectures.DQC to be effective and efficient, a quantum compiler must find the best partitioning for
the quantum algorithm and then perform smart remote operation scheduling to optimize Einstein– Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) pair consumption. A modular quantum compilation framework for DQC that takes into account both network
and device constraints and characteristics. We implemented and tested a quantum compiler based on the proposed framework with some circuits of interest, such as the VQE and
QFT ones, considering different network topologies, with quantum processors characterized by heavy- hexagon coupling maps
